# OpenTron

OpenTron is an implementation of the Tron blockchain written in Rust. This project is under active development and is
not ready for general use.

- [x] wallet-cli (the full feature wallet/rpc client)
  - [x] walletd (the wallet daemon)
- [ ] node-cli, under active development
  - [x] sync with java-tron node
  - [ ] transaction handling

## Rationale

1. Decentralised

   The Tron network currently has [one and only implementation](https://github.com/tronprotocol/java-tron). This
   has lead to some criticism of Tron being too centralized. We want to change that by providing an alternative
   implementation and independent development team.

2. High performance

   API calls to java-tron nodes often results in CPU timeouts and other "out of resource" related errors. This is partly
   due to java-tron being written in Java, a garbage collected language that runs on a virtual machine. OpenRust is
   written in Rust, a modern compiled language that is increasingly adopted for blockchain and systems development due
   to its high performance, safety and modern design.

3. Modern codebase

   Java-tron was forked a few years ago from a Java Ethereum implementation. It has accumulated a lot of technical debt
   over the years and has a lot of inconsistent or missing documentation. We believe that a greenfield implementation
   will enable us to produce a cleaner code base that is easier to understand, improve and extend. In addition, since
   Rust has first class support for WebAssembly, it will be possible to re-use its code for creating web based clients,
   wallets, explorers, etc.

## Roadmap

- [x] Block data sync, only blocks (raw transactions), without transaction info and any other state data. Handle chain fork and block Merkle tree verification.
- [ ] Simple transaction broadcast, without much verification, just broadcast transactions to the network as quickly as possible(an airdrop tool can be made from it)
- [ ] Handle transaction verification. all state data will be available. (difficult, EVM engine, resource consumption mode, witness/vote/proposal, chain parameter are all handled at this stage, to make the state data identical as java-tron )
- [ ] Build a query API layer upon state data. json-rpc.
- [ ] Build a event API layer upon state data.
- [ ] block mining logic (difficult, DPoS mining, need resource to become an SR)

See TODOs for more details.
